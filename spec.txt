=== Overview ===
Custom designed computer
8-bit data width
16-bit address bus -> 64KiB (Up to 16MiB with banking)
Memory banking with 8-bit MB register -> 256 possible memory banks, each 16KiB
Device I/O with inb and outb instructions

=== Instructions ===

--- Instruction layout ---
 XXXXYZZZ
X - 4-bit instruction identifier
Y - Is immediate bit (0 - register, 1 - immediate)
Z - 3-bit register identifier

--- Instruction set ---
0: MOV  reg, reg/im8   | reg = reg/im8
1: LDW  reg, [HL/im16] | reg = [HL/im16]
2: STW  [HL/im16], reg | [HL/im16] = reg
3: PUSH reg/im8        | [SP--] = reg/im8
4: POP  reg            | reg = [++SP]
5: LDA  im16           | HL = im16
6: JNZ  reg/im8        | reg/im8 != 0 ? PC = HL : NOP
7: INB  reg, reg/im8   | reg = PORT[reg/im8]
8: OUTB reg, reg/im8   | PORT[reg/im8] = reg
9: ADD* reg, reg/im8   | reg += reg/im8
A: ADC* reg, reg/im8   | reg += reg/im8 + c
B: AND  reg, reg/im8   | reg &= reg/im8
C: OR   reg, reg/im8   | reg |= reg/im8
D: NOR  reg, reg/im8   | reg = ~(reg | reg/im8)
E: CMP* reg, reg/im8   | f = cmp(reg, reg/im8)
F: SUB* reg, reg/im8   | reg -= reg/im8 - b

reg  - A register (will be included in the opcode byte or immediately following the opcode byte)
im8  - An 8-bit immediate value (Immediates are bytes following immediatly after the instruction)
im16 - A 16-bit immediate value

*Modifies flags

=== Registers ===
Registers can be accesed in instructions using their identifier

0: A - General Purpose
1: B - General Purpose
2: C - General Purpose
3: D - General Purpose
4: Z - General Purpose
5: H - Index high
6: L - Index low
7: F - Flags (Least to most significant bit)
    LESS
    EQUAL
    CARRY
    BORROW

=== Memory Layout ===
0x0000 ... 0x7fff: General purpose ROM
0x8000 ... 0xbfff: General purpose RAM (Banked)
0xc000 ... 0xffef: General purpose RAM
0xfff0 ... 0xffff: Memory mapped registers
    0xfff0 ... 0xfffa: RESERVED
    0xfffb ... 0xfffb: Memory Bank (MB)
    0xfffc ... 0xfffd: Stack Pointer (SP)
    0xfffe ... 0xffff: Program Counter (PC)

--- Memory banking ---
Memory banks (at 0x8000 ... 0xbfff) may be swapped by setting the MB register
MB = 0: Built-in RAM
MB = 1: Built-in VRAM

=== I/O Ports ===
I/O Ports may be used to comunicate with external Input/Output devices (ie. a keyboard, mouse)
They can be accessed using the inb and outb instructions 

--- Reserved ports ---
0x00: Status Register (Least to most significant bit)
    Halt    (RW)
    Error   (RO)
    Power   (RW)

0x01: Graphics Mode Register (See Video Output)

=== Video Output ===
Video output data is stored in Video Memory (VRAM)
By default, graphics mode 00 - Monochrome is selected

--- Graphics modes ---
Graphics modes may be changed using port 0x01

Available modes:
00: Monochrome 256x256, 1 Bpp, Linear (8 KiB)
01: 4 Color 265x128, 2 Bpp, Linear (8 KiB)
02: 16 Color 256x128, 4 Bpp, Linear (16 KiB)

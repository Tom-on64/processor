# Processor
_(I haven't decided what to name this thing yet)_

### About
This is a custom computer/microprocessor/whatever that i made
It has a custom architecture and such
You can find the whole specification [here](./spec.txt)

### Assembler (WIP)
Since this thing is fully custom, it needs an assembler

### Emulator
Unless you want to build this (or make it into an IC), you'll have to use the emulator
